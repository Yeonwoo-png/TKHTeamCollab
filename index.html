I want to get really good at using the command prompt and become better at not overcomplicating things too much. Also, if I had one superpower I would want the ability to fly/teleport. Doesn't it sound fun to have the freedom of being able to go wherever you want to go?</p>

            <p class = "passion_brief p_color rubik">One of my passions is music! I got my first guitar when I was around 16 or 17 and other than a class I took in high school, I taught myself mostly. I love music and playing the guitar because I get to express my creativity. I get to plug in my amp to the guitar and change whatever frequency, volume, I get to do whatever. I also love playing the drums, the church I went to when I grew up needed a drummer when the old one left for college and I ended up picking up his spot by just watching him. The creativity I can express when playing the drums and the freedom I have is the reason why I love the drums as well.</p>

I just like health and fitness in general as the things I like to do fall into that category. I like cooking and I sometimes even make my own kimchi!</p>

                <p class = "game_info p_color rubik">I love Batman Arkham Knight, the game holds up even today in terms of graphics and the mechanics are fun as well. The nostalgia brings me joy whenever I play it and it's also on the console I enjoy the most, the Play Station.</p>

                <p class = "game_info p_color rubik">I also love Prototype because of the nostalgia it gives me. It's the same as Batman Arkham Knight where the mechanics are fun, the story is made well, and the graphics still look decent in this day and age.</p>
